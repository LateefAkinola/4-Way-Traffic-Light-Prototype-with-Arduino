This project aims at mimicking the process of controlling **a 4-way Traffic light system** using a Programmable Logical Controller.
The project provides a virtual environment for testing, as well as a miniature physical environment to show the output of the earlier conducted simulation in real-time.

### Introduction
As the population of the environment increases, the number of road users increases as well, thus, the need to control the order in which the road is used.
Traffic light systems play a crucial role in controlling the flow of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections.
A Programmable logical controller (PLC) is employed in place of humans to control this flow by managing the timing and sequencing of traffic lights.

This project includes a software-based simulation accompanied by its hardware miniature environment to show how the PLC is used to control this flow.
This simulated environment allows us to experiment with the configuration, test the algorithms, observe, modify and play around the program based on the output displayed.
It aims to provide a reconfigurable and user-friendly interface to interact with the simulated traffic lights

## Features of the Project
* Simulation of a 4-way traffic light system.
* Realistic traffic light behaviour, including red, yellow, and green signals.
* Configurable timing parameters for each phase of the traffic light cycle.
* User-friendly command-line interface to control the traffic light states.
* Visual representation of the traffic light states in the simulated environment
* Visual representation of the traffic light state in the physical miniature environment
